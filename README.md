Task 1: Introduction to Network Security Basics

Objective:
Understand the basics of network security by learning about different types of network threats and
how to implement basic security measures. This task will introduce you to the foundational concepts
of securing a small network.

Skills:
Basic Network Security, Threat Identification, Security Best Practices

Tools:
Firewall (Windows Defender Firewall or a basic hardware firewall), Wireshark.

Guidelines:The

1. Learn Network Security Concepts:
   
- Research and summarize different types of network threats, including viruses, worms,
trojans, and phishing attacks.
- Understand basic security concepts like firewalls, encryption, and secure network
configurations.

2. Implement Basic Security Measures:

- Set up a simple network environment, such as your home network or a virtual lab with a
router and one or two connected devices.
- Enable and configure a basic firewall (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall) to block
unauthorized access.
- Set up basic security configurations, such as changing default passwords and enabling
network encryption (WPA2 or WPA3).

3. Monitor Network Traffic:

- Use Wireshark to capture and analyse network traffic.
- Identify different types of traffic, such as HTTP, DNS, and others, and understand what
they mean.
- Learn how to spot unusual or suspicious traffic that might indicate a security threat.

4. Document Findings:
o A summary of the network threats you researched.
o The security measures you implemented and why.
o Screenshots or descriptions of the traffic you captured with Wireshark.
o A discussion on how these basic security measures help protect the network.
